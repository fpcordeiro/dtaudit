\title{Validate Join Operations Between Two Data Tables}
\usage{
validate_join(x, y, by = NULL, by.x = NULL, by.y = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.table (left table).}

\item{y}{A data.table (right table).}

\item{by}{Character vector of column names to join on (used for both tables).}

\item{by.x}{Character vector of column names in \code{x} to join on.}

\item{by.y}{Character vector of column names in \code{y} to join on.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{validate_join} containing:
\describe{
\item{x_name, y_name}{Names of the input tables from the original call}
\item{by.x, by.y}{Key columns used for the join}
\item{counts}{List with row counts, match rates, and overlap statistics}
\item{duplicates}{List with duplicate key information for each table}
\item{summary_table}{A data.table summarizing the join diagnostics}
\item{relation}{Character string: "one-to-one", "one-to-many", "many-to-one",
"many-to-many", or "no matches"}
\item{keys_only_in_x}{Keys present in x but not in y}
\item{keys_only_in_y}{Keys present in y but not in x}
}
}
\description{
Analyzes a potential join between two data.tables without performing the
actual merge. Reports relationship type (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.),
match rates, duplicate keys, and unmatched rows.
}
\examples{
library(data.table)
dt1 <- data.table(id = c(1, 2, 3, 3), value = c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
dt2 <- data.table(id = c(2, 3, 4), score = c(10, 20, 30))
result <- validate_join(dt1, dt2, by = "id")
print(result)
